## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

Like I mentioned in my email, this class was very difficult and confusing for me so I'm honeslty not even sure if my project will work at all. I am well aware that it is very basic and probably something even your intro students could do but I worked with the little bit that I knew. I tried looking back on the assignments and tried to go off of that but it just made me more confused. I have probably run and rerun this project one hundred times with a bunch of different code and I have no idea why one worked and another didn't. Loading the data was very difficult for me and while i originally had it on a path from my computer, i realized that wouldn't work when it came time for someone else to run the code. I'm unsure if i even need the pandaslib.py but I suppose it's better to have it than not. After figuring out bringing in the dataset, the hardest part was getting the ouput to look like a table and not a mess of data and it took a lot of trial and error but I did it. The streamlit isn't perfect or the visualize or really any of it but I did and I finished.
